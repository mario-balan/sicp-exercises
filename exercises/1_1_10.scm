; Substituting (A 1 10), only b expands, since a is already 1:

(A 1 10)
; (A 0 (A 1 9))
; (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 8)))
; (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 7))))
; (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 6)))))
; (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 5))))))
; (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 4)))))))
; (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 3))))))))
; (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 2)))))))))
; (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 1 1))))))))))
; (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 2)))))))))
; (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 4))))))))
; (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 8)))))))
; (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 16))))))
; (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 32)))))
; (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 64))))
; (A 0 (A 0 (A 0 128)))
; (A 0 (A 0 256))
; (A 0 512)
; 1024

; The results for the next ones:

(A 2 4) ; is 65536.

(A 3 3) ; is also 65536. It is interesting that (A 3 3) resolves to (A 2 4) at some point.


; II.

; Writing these procedures in mathematical terms (actually written in the python interpreter syntax):

(define (k n) (* 5 n n)) ; would be 5 * n ** 2

; For (n > 0):

(define (f n) (A 0 n)) ; would be 2 * n
(define (g n) (A 1 n)) ; would be 2 ** n
(define (h n) (A 2 n)) ; is super exponential and looks like 2 ** 2 ... done (n - 1) times.
